# blender-buildbot-downloader
This is a Python script that fetches the latest Win64 build for Blender. It expects to be run on a Win64 system with Python3.

It should not be hard to alter this script so it autodetects the OS and downloads the appropriate version. This is GitHub so you can do that yourself. :)
